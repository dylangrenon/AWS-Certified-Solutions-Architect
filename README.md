  I am beginning to track my studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exams with this repo.  I am already 30% complete the Udemy course when begining this documentation.
  
  My goal is to be exam ready for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam and then begin a short study period for the Cloud practitioner exam as there are many overlapping topics in the exams.  I will first get the Cloud Practitioner certification then shortly after get the Solutions Architect.  After completing these two certifications, I will further my learning of Java software development and focus on learning microservices and Kubernetes with Java.  At the time of writing this, I am currently a Applications Analyst and my career goal for 2023 is to begin a career in software/IT Engineering, particularly a role utilizing the cloud.
