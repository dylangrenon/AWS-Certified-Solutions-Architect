  I am beginning to track my studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exams with this repo.  I am already 30% complete the Udemy course when begining this documentation as of 12/30/22. At the time of writing this, I am currently an Applications Analyst and plan to improve my Cloud, DevOps, IT, and software development skills consistently through 2023.
  
  My goal is to be exam ready for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam and then begin a short study period for the Cloud practitioner exam as there are many overlapping topics in the exams. 
  
After completing these two certifications, I will further my learning in:
  
  Linux - LPI Linux Essentials certification
  - create and restore compressed backups and archives.
  - create and run scripts
  - system security
  - users/groups
  - file permissions for public and private directories
  
  Java
  - Microservices
  - REST API
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Cloud
  - Kubernetes
  
  Python
  - Data Scrtuctures and Algorithms
  - OOP
  - Scripting and Automation
  - Docker
